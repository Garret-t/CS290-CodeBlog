                The most challenging aspect of the assignment was figuring out how 
                to handle different path requests. In Express.js it is relatively simple with 
                app.get('path', callback). However, with just the HTTP module, it was a little more 
                involved. I decided to just make use of the request.url variable and match that to 
                corresponding paths. This may not be the best way to do this, but it gets the job 
                done for this assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                From this assignment I learned about the request and response arguments for the 
                HTTP module. I learned how to set the headers and content type of an HTTP transaction. 
                Additionally, I learned about how to actually display data from the server side. Before 
                starting this assignment, I had a vague sense of how HTTP transactions work with GET, POST, 
                PUT, and DELETE requests, but I was not aware of the anatomy with status codes and headers.
            </p>

                The lecture notes were very helpful in completing the assignment. All the necessary functions 
                and variables in the http and fs module were readily available from the lecture notes. Additionally, I 
                looked at the http module documentation to see if there was any easy way to handle routing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used google to search for ways to handle routing. I was unnsuccessful in my search as most resources 
                brought up only Express.js. I decided to just go ahead with my routing solution that I 
                mentioned above.

                The most challenging part of this assignment was selecting the proper DOM elements 
                to manipulate. I expected .getElementsByClassName() and .querySelectorAll() to 
                return an array of elements. However, I ran into issues because these .getElementsByClassName()
                returns an array-like object and .querySelectorAll() returns a NodeList. This caused some issues 
                as it is not as easy to manipulate these data types and iterate over them. Thus, 
                I googled how to convert them to arrays and solved my problem with Array.from().
            </p>

            <p>
                I learned how to make a page interactive from this assignment. I will definitely 
                be referencing and remembering back to what I have done in this assignment for 
                future web dev endeavors. I already knew some JavaScript prior to this assignment, 
                but this assignment aided in my understanding of the DOM. I thought the way of hiding 
                parts of the page with a class .hidden was neat and also the searching feature seems 
                like it would be helpful in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lecture notes were the most helpful. Almost all the information I needed was in those 
                notes. I only had to reference the MDN Web Docs a couple times for specifics on what 
                functions returned and what they did. If I ran into an issue, I first checked he lecture notes, 
                if that did not solve my problem, then I checked MDN Web Docs, and as a last resort, I used Google.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, I had to Google information on how to use the returned 
                values from .getElementsByClassName() and .querySelectorAll(). Additionally, I Googled 
                the name for the input event, which I could not figure out on my own even though it seems 
                intuitive.

                Identifying the specific CSS properties to use was the most challenging
                aspect of this assignment. It is easy for me to forget the result of 
                certain properties when applied to selectors. I solved this issue by
                constantly referencing the MDN Web Docs. Perhaps the most challenging part 
                of this assignment was sizing and spacing elements appropriately. This 
                challenge was solved by trial and error.
            </p>

                From this assignment I learned how to use flexboxes in a project. I knew of 
                the general idea behind flexboxes, but it was helpful to implement them.
                Additionally, I learned how to style a web page so that it is somewhat responsive.
                This seems like a valuable skill in the future. I already knew about the box model
                with margins and padding, however, I still struggled to get things looking similar
                to the mocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MDN web docs were the most helpful in completing this assignment. I used 
                the MDN web docs to get specific information on CSS properties. Additionally,
                the lecture notes were a great resource for getting started. I used the lecture notes
                in the beginning of the assignment to style what I could from that resource, then switched
                to MDN Web Docs and Google.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to use Google to figure out how to get the button to stay when scrolling,
                styling the buttons and increasing the size of the icons. I Googled a lot more on the
                properties of elements, but most relevant links were to the MDN Web Docs, which I
                have mentioned a lot. 
            </p>

                The first challenge in this assignment was ensuring that I properly 
                cloned the repository as I was unsure to use HTTPs or SSH. Lecture and lecture
                notes addressed this question, so I decided to use HTTPs as it seemed to be the 
                fastest way as I do not have a SSH key setup (although I was tempted).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge was writing long paragraphs. I find that it is annoying to 
                constantly be pressing ENTER to start a new line in the editor. I googled a 
                better way to write these paragraphs, but I did not really find the answer I was 
                looking for; perhaps I will explore this more in the future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From this assignment I re-learned the basics of git and HTML. It has been 
                almost 4 or 5 years since I have done anything related to web development. It 
                was helpful to reiterate concepts and syntax. I already knew about a lot of the tags 
                in HTML(h1, h2, h3, p, a, ul, li) and the basic commands of git(add, commit, push), but there were some instances where I 
                needed to reference documentation or lecture notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Class notes and lecture were the most helpful for completing this assignment.
                I was able to find everything I needed there. Another helpful resource is the 
                MDN Web Docs, I had no idea this website existed and it is a quality resource.
