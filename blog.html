                Identifying the specific CSS properties to use was the most challenging
                aspect of this assignment. It is easy for me to forget the result of 
                certain properties when applied to selectors. I solved this issue by
                constantly referencing the MDN Web Docs. Perhaps the most challenging part 
                of this assignment was sizing and spacing elements appropriately. This 
                challenge was solved by trial and error.

                From this assignment I learned how to use flexboxes in a project. I knew of 
                the general idea behind flexboxes, but it was helpful to implement them.
                Additionally, I learned how to style a web page so that it is somewhat responsive.
                This seems like a valuable skill in the future. I already knew about the box model
                with margins and padding, however, I still struggled to get things looking similar
                to the mocks.
            </p>

                The MDN web docs were the most helpful in completing this assignment. I used 
                the MDN web docs to get specific information on CSS properties. Additionally,
                the lecture notes were a great resource for getting started. I used the lecture notes
                in the beginning of the assignment to style what I could from that resource, then switched
                to MDN Web Docs and Google.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to use Google to figure out how to get the button to stay when scrolling,
                styling the buttons and increasing the size of the icons. I Googled a lot more on the
                properties of elements, but most relevant links were to the MDN Web Docs, which I
                have mentioned a lot.

                The first challenge in this assignment was ensuring that I properly 
                cloned the repository as I was unsure to use HTTPs or SSH. Lecture and lecture
                notes addressed this question, so I decided to use HTTPs as it seemed to be the 
                fastest way as I do not have a SSH key setup (although I was tempted).

                Another challenge was writing long paragraphs. I find that it is annoying to 
                constantly be pressing ENTER to start a new line in the editor. I googled a 
                better way to write these paragraphs, but I did not really find the answer I was 
                looking for; perhaps I will explore this more in the future.

                From this assignment I re-learned the basics of git and HTML. It has been 
                almost 4 or 5 years since I have done anything related to web development. It 
                was helpful to reiterate concepts and syntax. I already knew about a lot of the tags 
                in HTML(h1, h2, h3, p, a, ul, li) and the basic commands of git(add, commit, push), but there were some instances where I 
                needed to reference documentation or lecture notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Class notes and lecture were the most helpful for completing this assignment.
                I was able to find everything I needed there. Another helpful resource is the 
                MDN Web Docs, I had no idea this website existed and it is a quality resource.
