    <h3>Assignment 1</h3>

        The first challenge in this assignment was ensuring that I properly 
        cloned the repository as I was unsure to use HTTPs or SSH. Lecture and lecture
        notes addressed this question, so I decided to use HTTPs as it seemed to be the 
        fastest way as I do not have a SSH key setup (although I was tempted).

        Another challenge was writing long paragraphs. I find that it is annoying to 
        constantly be pressing ENTER to start a new line in the editor. I googled a 
        better way to write these paragraphs, but I did not really find the answer I was 
        looking for; perhaps I will explore this more in the future.

        From this assignment I re-learned the basics of git and HTML. It has been 
        almost 4 or 5 years since I have done anything related to web development. It 
        was helpful to reiterate concepts and syntax. I already knew about a lot of the tags 
        in HTML(h1, h2, h3, p, a, ul, li) and the basic commands of git(add, commit, push), but there were some instances where I 
        needed to reference documentation or lecture notes.

        Class notes and lecture were the most helpful for completing this assignment.
        I was able to find everything I needed there. Another helpful resource is the 
        MDN Web Docs, I had no idea this website existed and it is a quality resource.
