                <strong>Complex/Interesting experience with Web Dev</strong>
                <p>
                    I attempted to create a forum and chat room once. There were
                    many security flaws in editing/posting and the credentials were
                    handled very poorly. This experience illuminated the complexities
                    of web development for me as it was the first time I tried to do
                    anything with a server and database.

                <strong>What I hope to learn from this class</strong>
                <p>
                    I hope to solidify my understanding of web development past my 
                    prior experience as a hobbiest in high school. I want to fully 
                    understand how to utilize client and server side JS and make 
                    responsive websites with CSS and JS.

                <strong>Unique Experience</strong>
                <p>
                    When I went to Berlin and Munich in Germany (pre-covid of course), I was thoroughly
                    dissappointed by the coffee there. Most of the local coffee shops
                    used light-roast beans and heavily dilluted it with creamer. The only place 
                    to find that bitter-sweeet dark-roasted coffee was at Starbucks. 
                    I proceded to get my coffee from Starbucks in shame for the rest of 
                    the trip. Nothing wrong with Starbucks, I would just prefer to support local places.
